# Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4) for Large-scale Multi-task Disaggregation of Urban Morphology

Note: This repository has not been finalized yet. We are doing some final checks to ensure reproducibiltiy and clear organization of files, codes, and data for #OpenScience. We expect to release this sometime around November 2024. In the meantime, you may check our [Zenodo repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13788604) for a preview of the DeepC4 outputs and our [AGU 2024 Abstract](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu24/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1610379) for more information. Many thanks for your interest. - Joshua Dimasaka
